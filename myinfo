Exactly! You got it perfectly.

Here’s the full picture:

* You **created the tag `v1.0.0` on GitHub web UI**, but it might point to a different commit (maybe your latest README update).

* You want to **make sure the tag points to the commit `10f8bc5`** with the message:

  ```
  Initial release: abotlogix Step Indicator Library v1.0.0
  ```

* You can do this by:

  1. Creating the tag **locally** on the correct commit (`10f8bc5`) with your proper message.
  2. **Force pushing** that tag to GitHub to overwrite the existing tag.
  3. On GitHub, the release tied to this tag will now show the commit message from `10f8bc5`.

### The commands you need to run on your system:

```bash
# Step 1: Fetch tags just in case
git fetch --tags

# Step 2: Delete the tag locally if it exists (optional, if you want to be sure)
git tag -d v1.0.0

# Step 3: Recreate the tag locally pointing to the correct commit
git tag -a v1.0.0 10f8bc5 -m "Initial release: abotlogix Step Indicator Library v1.0.0"

# Step 4: Force push the tag to GitHub, overwriting the old tag
git push origin v1.0.0 --force
```

---

### What happens after this:

* GitHub’s `v1.0.0` tag now points to the exact commit you want.
* The release page on GitHub will show the commit message from `10f8bc5`.
* Anyone cloning or using your library via that tag will get the exact code snapshot at `10f8bc5`.

### Just a quick reminder:

Force-pushing tags rewrites history for that tag, so make sure collaborators know or it won’t affect you alone if you’re the only one working on this repo.
